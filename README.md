For this analyzed we analyzed data from an automotive manufacturing company "AutosRU". 
Their most recent design is suffering from production issues.
This analysis is designed to provide more insights to mitigate these issues. ![02D1BF0C-0698-4316-BCEB-954DC69005AB](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112785655/210905546-7f2076c4-4cf3-4c7a-987c-e7f51ff9cd87.jpeg)
Here we performed our linear regression which is used to predict the value of a variable based on the value of another variable.

Next we performed our statictics summary on the suspension coils as total_summary
The design specifications require that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch.
If we have a lot that exceeds 100 pounds per square inch in the variance category we can classify it as defective.

The variance in the total summary seems to be in good standing. 

Next we were required to perform a summary for each individual lot. ![1B9FA1FE-DF85-49B2-AC2F-550AEDE9EE34](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112785655/210907342-d6845fc0-a50e-46fe-908f-c4a0b8f5410a.jpeg)
Here we can see that lots 1 and 2 are well below the threshold but lot 3 is not. Lot 3 is does not meet the requirements. T
